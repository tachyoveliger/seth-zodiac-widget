A grim, grim time, with all heat leached from the world, the Sun’s single remaining Head meekish shivering, its back to the glowering vault for which it is named.",

The breath of the Firmaments, a rich solution of powerful, volatile fuels that enrich the bodies of living things, that carry rot and the scent of gore over vast swathes, that simply cannot be lived without. A neutral Head, a time of quietude and reconciliation after the trials of its heavy predecessor. Not warm, but warming.",

The inflictor of intense pain, the inflictor of hard beatings. A time of rearing up, of wounds turned to scars, baked in the rising heat, now hardy rough callouses.",

The one who feels pain, who feels everything, without whom there is no feeling, without whom there is nothing to die. A time of sensation, of real heat, flourishing, pleasure, endless pleasure. A time of ignoring what is to come.",
      fire: "Fire, prodigious Fire! The hotter-than-all, the unmatched in power, the Burning of the Firmaments under their own glory, their maddened reverie. All Seven Heads scream in blazing mania, the frightful orchestra of apotheosis. That which destroys what it loves, what it loves to behold. A time of rising energy, fit-to-burst, of short tempers and hands that quick-hot snatch for drooling blades."
