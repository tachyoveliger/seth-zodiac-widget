      earth: "Earth, the stuff of things, the underfoot, that Pressure that holds the Firmaments in place, that holds and nurtures the deep writhing filaments of the world above in amniotic warmth, unseen and unrewarded. A stoic time, of preparation for what lies ahead, of pre-emptive goodbyes.",
      stone: "Stone, the Firmaments' carapace, their teeth, their memory, Stone that wields horrible Crushing power, the best defence and the bleakest cell. A grim, grim time, with all heat leached from the world, the Sun’s single remaining Head meekish shivering, its back to the glowering vault for which it is named.",
      air:   "Air, untouchable, unseeable, but always-touching, always-seen. The breath of the Firmaments, a rich solution of powerful, volatile fuels that enrich the bodies of living things, that carry rot and the scent of gore over vast swathes, that simply cannot be lived without. A neutral Head, a time of quietude and reconciliation after the trials of its heavy predecessor. Not warm, but warming.",
      metal: "Metal, the many-folded, the supple and strong, the made-strong by hard beatings and intense pain. The Firmaments’ tortured child, born first of the year, Dazing in bright shearing notes. The inflictor of intense pain, the inflictor of hard beatings. A time of rearing up, of wounds turned to scars, baked in the rising heat, now hardy rough callouses.",
      flesh: "Flesh, the Throbbing. The hearty second heir, the inheritor of the Firmaments. Assured of victory, of its own invincibility. The one who feels pain, who feels everything, without whom there is no feeling, without whom there is nothing to die. A time of sensation, of real heat, flourishing, pleasure, endless pleasure. A time of ignoring what is to come.",
      fire:  "Fire, prodigious Fire! The hotter-than-all, the unmatched in power, the Burning of the Firmaments under their own glory, their maddened reverie. All Seven Heads scream in blazing mania, the frightful orchestra of apotheosis. That which destroys what it loves, what it loves to behold. A time of rising energy, fit-to-burst, of short tempers and hands that quick-hot snatch for drooling blades."

      air:   "Orphan — empathetic and aware, but unsure of self, always the object of greater wills. An open wound.",
      metal: "Maverick — alert and self-assured, but arrogant, childish even. A loose tooth.",
      flesh: "Gambler — observant and composed, but driven by material needs, either real or imagined. A constant risk.",
